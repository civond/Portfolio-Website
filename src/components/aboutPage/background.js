            <br/>I received my BS degree in Biology and Psychology, with minors in Mathematics and Chemistry 
            from the University of Oregon in March 2020. 
            
            Since then, I have been working as a laboratory technician in SmearLab, which I have been a part of since early 2018 (as an undergrad).
            <br/><br/>
            During this time, I have realized the importance of computers in scientific research and
            have developed a knack for programming. Thus, I have been undertaking a variety of coding projects (using
            Python, MATLAB, JavaScript, ect) for my own personal benefit or for my lab (see "Projects"
            page for more details).
            <br/><br/>
            I am also fluent in English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese. 
            For more complete background information, please refer to my CV.
