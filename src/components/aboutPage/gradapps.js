            For anyone who would like to listen, here is my personal journey while applying for graduate school (it was incredibly chaotic and turbulent).
            If you can gain something from it - awesome :) This section will be divided into three main parts:
            <br/><br/>
            <div id="centeredbox">

            <h4>My Original Plans</h4><hr width="100%" color="black"></hr>

            
            For a long time, I have dreamt of living and working in Japan - at least for a while.
            Another alternative to this was going back to Taiwan. Thus, my original plan after graduating from university
            was to land a job in one of those countries.
            
            My original plan after graduating was to go back to Taiwan or Japan for job hunting and work for a few years.
            then apply for masters programs in computational biology / bioinformatics. However, due to the current state of "Global Pandemic",
            that ended up not happening, lol.        
            
            <br/><br/>
            <h4>Why Neuroscience</h4><hr width="100%" color="black"></hr>
            My decision to pursue neuroscience for my graduate studies was heavily influenced by two professors - 
            Dr. Matt Smear - my PI, and Dr. Janis Weeks - my study abroad advisor. 
            Matt made it clear to me that when pursuing my goals, I should be searching for the best "tool" 
            that will give the best training. Janis on the other hand, is a living example of not following the "prescribed path".
            She was a neuroscience researcher for most of her career, but switched to parasitology in her later years and now 
            partakes in global health work across Sub-Saharan Africa. 
            <br/><br/>

            My experiences with these two together, allowed me to realize that neuroscience is the path for me. 
            When I reflect on everything that has happened in my life, this might actually be fate, if there is such a thing. 
            My grandmother suffered a catostrophic stroke and lost nearly all motor function, my aunt died from complications due to Parkinson's.
